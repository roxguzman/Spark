Project Motivation:
This is udacity's capstone project, using spark to analyze user behavior data from music app Sparkify.
Sparkify is a music app, this dataset contains two months of sparkify user behavior log. The log contains some basic information about the user as well as information about a single action. A user can contain many entries. In the data, a part of the user is churned, through the cancellation of the account behavior can be distinguished.

Files Description:
Sprakify .ipynb Main file of the project, it demonstrates the process of using pyspark to explore the data and build the model.

Result:
According to the results of the model, it is the frequency of Thumbs Down that has the greatest impact. Churn users have more Thumbs Down. Naturally, users will leave if they are not satisfied.
